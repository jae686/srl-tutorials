#SRL
## Description
SRL is a wrapper , written in C++23 , that sits on top of SGL.
The main goal is to simplify the development process on the SEGA Saturn.
The library includes a class to deal with fixed point math, as efficently as possible on the sega saturns hardware, via the [SaturnMathPP](https://github.com/robertoduarte/SaturnMathPP) library, as well as classes to access resources such as the VDP1 and VDP2.
