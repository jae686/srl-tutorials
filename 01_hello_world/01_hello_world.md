# A Simple Hello World

## Anatomy of a SRL project

> [!NOTE]
> It is recomended to out your project files under `SaturnRingLib/Projects`

> [!TIP]
> It is more simple to copy a sample into the `Projects` folder and then add or change files as needed.

### Folder and File Structure :

+ `Your Project Folder`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `Makefile` This makefile has configuration settings for SRL.
  - `compile.bat` compiles the project
  - `clean.bat` cleans the build directory
  - `run_with_mendafen.bat` runs the project inside mendafen emulator
  - `src/` contains your project source files
  - `cd/` files to be placed on the final, burned CD. File such as TGA files, NYA files, etc
  - `BuildDrop/` contains the final build ISO

### src/main.cxx

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial assumes that a empty `main.cxx` file exists on the `<project folder>/src` folder.

All programs using SRL must use the `srl.hpp` header at the start.

```cpp 
#include <srl.hpp>
```

Is is also recomended (but not mandatory), for legibility issues, to use the apropriate namespaces.
SRL provides many datatypes designed to help with saturn development.

```cpp
using namespace SRL::Types;
using namespace SRL::Math::Types;
```

SRL program entry point is, as usual with C++ programs, the `int main()` function.
Before the use of any SRL function, it must be initialized via the `SRL::Core::Initialize` function. A [`SRL::Types::HighColor`](https://srl.reye.me/structSRL_1_1Types_1_1HighColor.html) containing the color must be provided.

> [!TIP]
> SRL already defines some [colors that the programmer can use](https://srl.reye.me/classSRL_1_1Types_1_1HighColor_1_1Colors.html), without having to manually define its RGB values. For example `SRL::Types::HighColor::Colors::Black` for the black color. Now you can see why we define namespaces in order to ease the use of SRL defined types.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SRL *MUST* be initialized before the use of any SRL functionality.

The code, so far, looks like this

```cpp
#include <srl.hpp>
using namespace SRL::Types;
using namespace SRL::Math::Types;

int main()
{
   SRL::Core::Initialize(HighColor::Colors::Black); 
   return 0;
}

```

Now that we have the SRL initialized, we can start using it.

We will begin how using the [`SRL::Debug`](https://srl.reye.me/classSRL_1_1Debug.html) class.

This class and its member functions are used to print information to the screen, and it's meant to aid in debuging tasks. In other words, you will be using it alot :) 

To print a text to the screen, the [`SRL::Debug::Print`](https://srl.reye.me/classSRL_1_1Debug_afa892baf3e31d364ffe07350c916696f.html#afa892baf3e31d364ffe07350c916696f) function is used. There are 2 overloads : one that allows the print a simple string, and another that is a [variadic function](https://srl.reye.me/classSRL_1_1Debug_a4ab210527af751fedbbc8877a019252f.html#a4ab210527af751fedbbc8877a019252f) that takes arguments in the same way as the classic `printf()` function.

Using this function can simply be done with :

```cpp
SRL::Debug::Print(1,1, "Hello World");
```

This should print the "Hello World" string at the x=1 ,y= 1 coordinates.

This will be the resulting program :

```cpp
#include <srl.hpp>

// Using to shorten names for Vector and HighColor
using namespace SRL::Types;
using namespace SRL::Math::Types;

// Main program entry
int main()
{
  SRL::Core::Initialize(HighColor::Colors::Black);
  SRL::Debug::Print(1,1, "Hello World");
  return 0;
}
```

**However this will not print anything on the screen.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the end of each frame the function [`SRL::Core::Synchronize()`](https://srl.reye.me/classSRL_1_1Core_a06c60715afe1f84b01286b5d7bc269e7.html#a06c60715afe1f84b01286b5d7bc269e7) must be called. Otherwise nothing will be drawn at the end of the frame.

The correct, working program looks like :

```cpp
#include <srl.hpp>

// Using to shorten names for Vector and HighColor
using namespace SRL::Types;
using namespace SRL::Math::Types;

// Main program entry
int main()
{
  // Initialize library
  SRL::Core::Initialize(HighColor::Colors::Black);
  SRL::Debug::Print(1,1, "Hello World");
  SRL::Core::Synchronize(); 
  return 0;
}
```

To compile the project , in windows, you simple run the `compile.bat` in the project folder.
To run the project inside an emulator with `run_with_mednafen.bat` in the project folder.

## Sumary

On this short tutorial you learned that :
- To start using the library its recomended that you copy a sample program in the `samples` folder into the `Projects` folder, and modify and add from there. This ensures the helper scripts and makefile are already in place.
- Every SRL project must:
  - Include `srl.hpp` header
  - Initialize the SRL library before using any `SRL` function
  - Call `SRL::Core::Synchronize();` at the end of each frame
-  `SRL::Debug::Print(int x, int y, char* text)` can be used to print text into the screen.
